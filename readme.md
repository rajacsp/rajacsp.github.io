# Deepak's Personal Wiki | Deep Notes

Deployed at - [https://rajacsp.github.io/](https://rajacsp.github.io/)

This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of an online wiki.

The purpose of this site is to force me to improve the quality of these notes, the prospect of being read by someone being motivating. It also allows me to access it everywhere.

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look at [outline](https://rajacsp.github.io/#outline)

**Why I write (summed up in one quote) -** Your brain is for having ideas not holding them.

## Getting started

This garden is quite literally my digital brain. It includes my thoughts, notes and links on topics I care about.

I update the notes daily in my [github repo](https://github.com/rajacsp/rajacsp.github.io/), and build it few times in a month using Github Actions and Docusaurus.

The content being markdown files, which after every commit to the builds the website using docusaurus and publishes it to [rajacsp.github.io](https://rajacsp.github.io/) from which you are likely reading this page.

The way I structure each page often looks the same and follows a structure. The sidebar you see on the left is sorted alphabetically. It's nested too. Many top level folders are nested quite deep.

I use Zettlekasten Method for note taking and obsidian tool to manage and structure my notes. I have previously used Onenote but grown out of it in about 4 years, since it doesn't scale in terms of number of notes and doesn't have linking of notes

## Must Read Pages

There's 2000+ pages in here and lots of them I think are interesting. But these few can be nice starts for a read:

- [Quotes](https://rajacsp.github.io/knowledge/quotes-proverbs/) small phrases that makes my day and help me to remember and revise simple rules in a fun way
- [Mental Models](https://rajacsp.github.io/knowledge/general/mental-models/) that I have compiled over the years and helps me learn concepts quickly of any domain and connect concepts across domains
- [Learning how to learn](https://rajacsp.github.io/psychology/learning/learning-intro/) course that changed my learning approach and in turn my whole life, and the reason why I write and maintain these notes.
- [Book - Principles by Ray Dalio](https://rajacsp.github.io/book-summaries/principles/)
- [Fallacies of Distributed Computing](https://rajacsp.github.io/computer-science/distributed-system/fallacies-and-problems/) and [Biases / Fallacies](https://rajacsp.github.io/psychology/biases-fallacies/) of Human Computing, which everyone should know and try to overcome in their lifetimes
- [Types of Databases](https://rajacsp.github.io/databases/concepts/types-of-databases/) to organize your data in the right database, since data has gravity, it becomes harder with quantity of data to migrate data over time to other databases
- List of [YouTube / Podcasts](https://rajacsp.github.io/knowledge/youtube-podcasts-magazine-apps/) that I follow and [YouTube Videos](https://rajacsp.github.io/knowledge/links/) that I have watched. Also [Computer Science YouTube Videos](https://rajacsp.github.io/computer-science/links/) that I have watched since keeping yourself updated with the field is a must.
- [My Experiences](https://rajacsp.github.io/about-deepak-sood/experience/) over the years, [My Experiences](https://rajacsp.github.io/about-deepak-sood/meetups-talks-sessions/) I presented and [Social links](https://rajacsp.github.io/about-deepak-sood/social-links/) to connect with me
