GitHub Pages Deployment Fixes
==============================

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Missing Image References (Build Errors)
- **Problem**: Two images were referenced but not found in the media folder
  - `raja_csp_kong_in_action.jpg` in meetups-talks-sessions.md
  - `Personality-CSP-image1.jpg` in personality.md

- **Solution**: 
  - Changed reference to existing file: `deepak_sood_kong_in_action.jpg`
  - Fixed corrupted comment and used existing file: `Personality-image1.jpg`

### 2. GitHub Actions Permission Error
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions bot couldn't push to gh-pages branch (403 error)

- **Solution**: 
  - Added `permissions: contents: write` to workflow
  - Updated to peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
  - Added proper user configuration for git commits

### 3. Jekyll Build Error
- **Problem**: GitHub Pages was trying to build the site with Jekyll instead of using pre-built Docusaurus files

- **Solution**: 
  - Created `.nojekyll` file in repository root
  - Added step in workflow to create `.nojekyll` in build output
  - This tells GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll processing

## Files Modified:

1. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Updated deployment workflow
2. `docs/about-raja-csp/meetups-talks-sessions.md` - Fixed image reference
3. `docs/about-raja-csp/personality.md` - Fixed image reference
4. `.nojekyll` - Created to disable Jekyll processing

## Next Steps:

1. Commit and push these changes to the main branch
2. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger
3. Verify deployment at: https://rajacsp.github.io

## Additional Recommendations:

1. Go to GitHub repository Settings → Actions → General
2. Ensure "Workflow permissions" is set to "Read and write permissions"
3. This provides an extra layer of permission for the workflow

The build should now complete successfully and deploy to GitHub Pages!
